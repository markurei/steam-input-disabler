# Steam Input Disabler

A utility to conveniently disable or enable Steam input for all non-Steam games added via Lutris, HeroicLauncher, etc. in the Steamdeck.

## Description

Some games, specially ones that are added as non-Steam games, have issues regarding Steamdeck controls not being detected properly. Keyboard controls will be used intead, making the Steamdeck controls unusable.
The immediate workaround for this is to map mouse and keyboard keys to the controls in Steamdeck but the game itself would still display keyboard controls in-game.

Disabling the Steam input for that specific game fixes the issue. While it can be done manually, this application handles it automatically. This application disables or enables the Steam input setting from the Steam config itself fixing the controller and in-game controller prompts/display issues for non-Steam games.

> [!NOTE]
> Steam games does not have this issue since the user can disable Steam Input from the Steam UI directly.
> Non-Steam games does not show this option in the Steam UI for Steamdeck.

  
> [!WARNING]
> This application was tested only on Steamdeck running SteamOS.
> It may or may NOT work on other Linux distros.
> Does not work on Windows.
